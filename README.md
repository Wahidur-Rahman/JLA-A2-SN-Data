# JLA-A2-SN-Data
This github contains to data products to supplement Rahman et al. 2021 here https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12497


The updated lcparams file is attached to this github. The covariances are too large to store in github and can instead be found below in the drive links.

This covariance contains the new peculiar velocity corrections and removes the off-digonal colour corelations to be consistent with the selection effects methodlogy applied in Rahman et al. 2021

If you want the color covariances to be included because you want to ignore the selection effects analysis in the paper or apply your own, this version of the covariance matrix can be found here

nb: for each 3 x 3 sub matrix, the order of the covariance matrix is color, x1, mb on the diagonal.
